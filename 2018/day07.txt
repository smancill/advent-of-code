Setup:

    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> from day07 import read_data, part1, part2

    >>> data = read_data(StringIO("""\
    ... Step C must be finished before step A can begin.
    ... Step C must be finished before step F can begin.
    ... Step A must be finished before step B can begin.
    ... Step A must be finished before step D can begin.
    ... Step B must be finished before step E can begin.
    ... Step D must be finished before step E can begin.
    ... Step F must be finished before step E can begin.
    ... """))

Part 1:

    >>> part1(data)
    'CABDFE'

Part 2:

    >>> part2(data, 2, 0)
    15
